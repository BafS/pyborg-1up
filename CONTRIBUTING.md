Issues, pull requests, feedback all accepted and welcome.

Development workflow
====================

Use [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/index.html) and the pipfile[.lock]. It's really good.


Tips
====

If you break the brain format we have to do a "minor" version bump (e.g. 1.1->1.2).

Feature branches are encouraged but not required.
