Install
--------
We're now on the cheeseshop!

`pip install pyborg`


Notes
-----

Ancient original tarballs may be found at http://download.gna.org/pyborg/

Uses the pure python irc library "irclib" http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/ (Known to to work with 1.30 {I'm not actually sure of this now})


Todo:
-----

* spelling or better heuristics
* graphing and visualization of the database
* Move to irclib? (mutli server capable, or make pyborg thread-able.)
