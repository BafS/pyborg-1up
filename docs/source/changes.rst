Changelog summaries; for past changes check `the github releases <https://github.com/jrabbit/pyborg-1up/releases>`_


Next (1.4.0)
------------

- Added nickname plaintext pings in discord module.
- Discord.py 1.0 support (allows 3.7+ support in pyborg)
- `toml <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>`_ config files. They live in your pyborg conf folder and there's one for most modules. And one for pyborg's core options. These replace the old cfg files.
- Proper python 3 deps in `PEP508 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/>`_ compliant specifications in the setup.py. This'll make pypi installs easier on py3.
