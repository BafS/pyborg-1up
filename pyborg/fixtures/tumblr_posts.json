He keeps fresh sheets in a sealed and ventilated cedar closet he made from an old refrigerator, towels, too. He washes them in coin-op machines at the shower house, a ten-minute walk away through thick woods. They closed this cul-de-sac to regular campers almost ten years ago.

It is Friday, there is a good chance Cherrie will go to her sister’s for the evening. He types: 75% chance at the campground tonight. </p><p>Erin replies: I’ll be there.
